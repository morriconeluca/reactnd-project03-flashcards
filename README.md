# Flashcards Project for Udacity's React Nanodegree

This is the third of three project for my [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). I have build a mobile application (Android and iOS) with React Native and Redux. I used React Navigation version 5 and React hooks. The app allows users to study collections of flashcards. It will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

The project has been tested only on the Android platform.

## Why this project

This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input. By building this project, you will gain an understanding of how to use React Native to build an iOS and Android application.

## To get started

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`

## Expo

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://github.com/expo/expo). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://expo.io/learn) and [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
